# Libasm@42 - Assembly yourself
Libasm is the first project involving an assembly language. It consists in coding a few functions of the C library in x86-64.

## What's libasm?

Libasm is a little static library with a few functions that were written in x86-64 using the Intel syntax.

You can read the instruction [here soon]

In this project you:
- learn about **computer architecture** and especially how the CPU works
- learn how to **optimize** your high-level language code
- understand how to read assembly code and so **reverse engineer code** (when you don't have the source file)

I wrote a post on how to code in assembly with a practical example and a few resources. Head here to read this post [here soon ]


## How do I run this library?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmalki-h/libasm libasm/
cd libasm/
make
```
